## Overview

Inspired by my love of swimming outdoors, I decided to base my final project on wild swimming places across the UK.

### The Brief

The brief was to create a full-stack application by making my own backend using a Python Flask API with a Postgres database, and a front-end built with React that utilises Webpack. The application had to enable a user to register, login and add content. I also used React Mapbox GL and Dark Sky APIs in addition to my own to enhance the application.

### The Process
Before I started coding I made a Trello board to plan the project, writing down what the Postgres relationships were, what models and controllers were required for the backend, what components I needed in the front-end, and how I would manage the workload over the week. I then created wireframes for the front-end, before beginning to code the bulk of the backend and then starting on the front-end.

## Future enhancements

If I were to develop the project, I would like to turn the app into a journey planner for a wild swimming day out, pulling in more APIs like Citymapper (for travel information) and Yelp (for nearby pubs and restaurants) to build a full itinerary for a day of wild swimming! I would also use Mapbox, rather than React Mapbox GL.
